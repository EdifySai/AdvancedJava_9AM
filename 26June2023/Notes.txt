Caching: Caching is a mechanism to store the data that can be reused multiple times without hitting the 
data source for every request. 

Levels of Caching:

First Level Cache -  Session Level (Same user) - 1 user

 1 request ->   accessing a list of users (select * from users); -> Database -> users 

    result -> store it somewhere- cache

 2 request ->  accessing a list of users (select * from users); -> Database -> users 

 3 request ->  accessing a list of users (select * from users); -> Database -> users 


 Second Level Cache - Session Factory Level (different users) - multiple users. 


 user 1 ->  1req -> list of users -> DB  -> users and stores them in cache. 


 user 1 ->  2req -> list of users -> cache  -> users


 user2 -> 1 req ->   list of users ->  cache -> users
